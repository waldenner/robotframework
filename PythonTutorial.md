The purpose of this tutorial is to offer basics of Python language, concentrating on the features useful for writing Robot Framework test libraries. It also contains lots of links to advanced material.

The latest version of the tutorial is always  _**[available online](http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/doc/python/PythonTutorial.html)**_.

How to actually create test libraries is explained thoroughly in the [User Guide](UserGuide.md). This tutorial covers only the very basics but it also contains a simple
[example library](http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/doc/python/ExampleLibrary.py) and
[test cases](http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/doc/python/example_tests.tsv) that you can execute and otherwise investigate on your machine.

Improvement ideas, questions, and general comments related to the tutorial are highly appreciated here and on the [mailing lists](MailingLists.md).
