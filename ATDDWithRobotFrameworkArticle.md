Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) is an essential practice
applied by successful Agile and Scrum teams. It changes the purpose of
testing by using examples / tests for clarifying and documenting
requirements. This short paper is an extract from the Test chapter
found in book
[Practices for Scaling Lean & Agile Development](http://www.amazon.com/Practices-Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development/dp/0321636406)
by [Craig Larman](http://craiglarman.com) and [Bas Vodde](http://odd-e.com/).
