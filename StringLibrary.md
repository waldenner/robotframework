`String` is Robot Framework's standard library for manipulating
strings (e.g. `Replace String With Regexp`, `Split To Lines`) and
verifying their contents (e.g. `Should Be String`).
[BuiltIn library](BuiltInLibrary.md) has also some additional keywords that
can be used with strings.

`String` library is available from Robot Framework 2.1 onwards.

The full library documentation by release is found below. The
documentation of the latest minor version (e.g. 2.1.3) is always
applicable with earlier minor versions.
