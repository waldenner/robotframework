# Downloads #

We have moved most downloads to other services because [Google Code deprecated downloads](http://google-opensource.blogspot.fi/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html). We have also later [moved the whole project](GitHubMove.md) to [GitHub](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework).

## New locations ##

  * Installers are at [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework).
  * The standalone JAR is distributed via [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3Arobotframework).
  * User Guide is available at http://robotframework.org/robotframework/.
  * [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/robotframework/QuickStartGuide/blob/master/QuickStart.rst) has its own project.
  * [How to Use C](https://bitbucket.org/robotframework/cdemo) demo has its own project too.
  * [One Click Installer](https://bitbucket.org/robotframework/robottools/src/master/oneclickinstaller) is also a separate project.
