# Robot Framework 2.6 #

Robot Framework 2.6 is a new major release with loads of bigger
and smaller enhancements and bug fixes. It was released after several
[preview releases](PreviewReleases26.md) on Tuesday 26th July 2011.

Questions and comments related to the
release can be sent to the [mailing lists](MailingLists.md) and possible
bugs submitted to
the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues).

## Downloads and installation ##

Installers and other packages are available on the
[download page](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/downloads/list).

You can follow the normal [installation instructions](Installation.md)
when installing RF 2.6 releases. If you have an earlier Robot version installed
it should be safe to install over it. Removing the old version first is always
safer, though, and should always be done if installation fails somehow.

## Compatibility with RIDE and Mabot ##

Robot Framework 2.6 should be fully compatible with the earlier
[RIDE](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-ride/) releases but
unfortunately it is not compatible with the current
[Mabot](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-mabot/) release.

## Compatibility with outputs generated with RF 2.5 ##

Robot Framework 2.6 can read and process outputs generated by
2.5.x. releases. This allows testing the enhanced log and report (see
below) also without executing tests using 2.6. All you need to do is
get the output file (such as `ouput.xml`) and generate logs and
reports based on it with `rebot`.

# Most important enhancements and new features #

## Better log file performance ##

The biggest enhancement in this release is making the performance
of the log files better when the number of test cases and test data
increases ([issue 360](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=360)).

This enhancement is implemented so that when you open the log file it is
not loaded into the browsers memory fully but generated dynamically using
Javascript (and wonderful [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)) as you drill down to
more details. This both makes the log files' size on a disk much smaller
(in one case a log file that used to be 120MB is now 9MB) and also reduces
browsers' memory consumption dramatically (the earlier log file performed
flawlessly on a browser).

Creating the log files dynamically allows also interesting enhancements
in the future. Possible ideas include searching test cases and setting
log level. In RF 2.6 the log files should look pretty much like the ones
we all have got used to in previous releases, though.

## Transparent log splitting ##

A common problem when the number of test cases increases is that log
files gets too big. They do not open nicely into browsers anymore and
if they are on a remote machine downloading them takes too much time.

In RF 2.5 and earlier this problem was solved with a functionality to
split both log files and output files (`--splitoutputs` option) from a
predefined level. This
[functionality was removed](#Splitting_outputs_is_not_supported_anymore.md)
early during 2.6 development because it never worked that well and it
was incompatible with the new log generation system discussed above.

Although the new logs are order of magnitude smaller than earlier,
some log splitting functionality was still needed with very large test
suites. The new approach introduced in RF 2.6 ([issue 898](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=898)) is splitting
the log into smaller files that can be loaded dynamically when
needed. This approach has two huge benefits:

  * Main log file size stays small (log from Robot Framework's own acceptance tests with 2000+ tests is about 0.6MB).
  * Because the data is loaded dynamically, users do not see any difference compared to the situation where logs are not split.

The main drawback is that the overall size taken by the log file
increases. In practice this should not matter too much because not all
the data needs to be loaded into a browser, disk space is pretty cheap,
and the logs in 2.6 are otherwise so small compared to the old logs.

Another drawback is that copying log files or otherwise manipulating
them after the execution gets a bit more complicated when a log file has been splitted because you have
lot of small files. Technically data from each test and suite
setup/teardown is written into a separate Javascript file and the
number of files grows when the number of tests grows. The files have
name in format `'log-42.js'` where `'log'` changes depending on the
actual name of the log file and `'42'` is a growing index.

The new mechanism is transparent for users viewing the log file but it
still needs to be enabled with `--splitlog` option when tests are run
or results post-processed with `rebot`.

## Enhanced and better performing report ##

In RF 2.6 also report files are generated dynamically and are thus
smaller and have better performance than earlier. In addition to that,
reports have also got some new functionality.

The smaller size (in one case from 9MB to 0.4MB) and faster opening
time are due to reports not showing test cases automatically but instead
having an easy way to select what you actually want to see. Old test details
by suite and test details by tag tables have been removed and replaced
with dynamically generated tables that show the same information ([issue 849](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=849)).
In addition to these views being accessible from the statistics table
like the removed tables in earlier releases, you also have drop-down menus
where you can select which suite or tag to show.

A totally new functionality in reports is having a view where
all tests or all critical tests can be seen ([issue 863](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=863)). Tests in these
views are sorted so that failed tests are first (similarly as when viewing
tests by tag) so it is very easy to see all failed or all failed critical
tests in one place. These views are also accessible from the statistics table.

The screenshot below is from the [User Guide](http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/doc/userguide/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#report-file)
that also contains a live version of the same report.

![http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/doc/userguide/src/ExecutingTestCases/report_passed.png](http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/doc/userguide/src/ExecutingTestCases/report_passed.png)

## Keyword teardown functionality ##

Robot Framework has always had test and suite level setups and teardowns,
but nowadays also individual user keywords can have their own teardowns
([issue 711](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=711)). The mechanism of this new feature is very simple, the keyword
teardown is executed both when the keyword passes and when it fails.

Keyword teardowns allow, for example, splitting a large test teardown
into more fine-grained teardowns that are executed closer to the activity
that needs to be cleaned up. Another good use case is with test templates
(a new feature in [RF 2.5](ReleaseNotes25.md)) where
the system should be in a known state after every repeated step.

Using keyword teardown and test templates is illustrated by the example
below. It shows a different approach to create invalid login cases from the
[SeleniumLibrary demo](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-seleniumlibrary/wiki/Demo):

```
    ***Settings***
    Test Setup       Open login page
    Test Template    Login with invalid credentials should fail
    Test Teardown    Close browser
    Resource         common_resource.txt

    ***Test Cases***
    Invalid login
        ${VALID USER}    invalid
        invalid          ${VALID PASSWORD}
        invalid          invalid
        ${VALID USER}    ${EMPTY}
        ${EMPTY}         ${VALID PASSWORD}
        ${EMPTY}         ${EMPTY}

    ***Keywords***
    Login with invalid credentials should fail
        [Arguments]    ${username}    ${password}
        Input user name    ${username}
        Input password     ${password}
        Submit credentials
        Welcome page should be open
        [Teardown]    Navigate to login page
```

Notice that keyword teardown functionality is currently not supported
by [RIDE](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-ride/).

## New logging APIs and other logging enhancements ##

Robot Framework 2.6 has its own Python API for logging
(`robot.api.logger` module) ([issue 339](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=339)) and it also supports Python's
standard [logging](http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html) module
([issue 455](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=455)). These APIs make both make logging cleaner than using the
standard output and also provide nice functionality such as accurate
timestamps. They are explained more thoroughly, and with examples, in
the
[User Guide](http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/doc/userguide/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#public-logging-api).

Another logging related enhancement is that libraries can embed
accurate timestamp into the messages logged through stdout/stderr
([issue 456](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=456)). Python based libraries are probably better of using the
new logging APIs, but this enhancement adds timestamp support also for
Java based libraries as well as for libraries that utilize the
[remote interface](RemoteLibrary.md).

Finally, messages logged during library initialization are nowadays written into the syslog ([issue 892](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=892)).

## Support for custom regexps with embedded argument syntax ##

The [embedded argument syntax](http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/doc/userguide/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#embedding-arguments-into-keyword-name)
nowadays supports using a custom regular expression to match the used
arguments ([issue 854](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=854)). This is especially useful to prevent name
collisions with keywords having similar names.

# Backwards incompatible changes #

## Viewing logs and reports requires a modern browser ##

Logs and reports nowadays use Javascript and CSS styles that only work
well in modern browsers. Firefox 3.5, IE 8, or equivalent is required,
but newer browsers are recommended. Most notable IE 6 and IE 7
are not supported at all.

Newer browsers, such as Firefox 4 and Google Chrome 12, have blazingly
fast Javascript engines and they can easily view even very large log
files. Upgrading your browser may thus be a good idea even if you can open
logs and reports with your old browser.

Viewing in Excel is not supported anymore. You can still copy statistics and other results from logs and reports to Excel, though.

If your company policy prevents you from upgrading IE or using
alternative browsers, you can always keep on using older Robot
Framework versions.

## IronPython is currently not supported ##

Unfortunately Robot Framework 2.6 does not work with
[IronPython](DotNetSupport.md).
You can use Robot Framework 2.5.7 with IronPython until we manage
work around the incompatibilities listed in [issue 917](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=917).

## Splitting outputs is not supported anymore ##

The earlier explained big
[log file performance enhancements](#Better_log_file_performance.md)
unfortunately completely broke the old output splitting functionality
([issue 861](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=861)). Fixing splitting so that it would work like it worked
earlier would have been a really big task.

Outputs have been split mainly to make log files smaller by splitting
them into pieces that should not grow too big. Because the old
approach never worked too well (see e.g. [issue 386](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=386) and [issue 862](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=862)), a
decision was made to rather implement new
[log splitting approach](#Transparent_log_splitting.md).

In RF 2.6 using `--splitoutputs` option gives you a warning and in RF
2.7 the option will be removed altogether. New `--splitlog` option
should be used instead.

## Summary reports were removed ##

As explained above, reports in Robot Framework 2.6
[do not have tests open when you open them](#Enhanced_and_better_performing_report.md)
and in practice they look a lot like the old summary reports. Because reports
are generated dynamically, their size is also very small.

Because summary reports did not provide any value anymore they were
removed ([issue 864](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=864)).

## `testdoc.py` tool does not work currently ##

Unfortunately [testdoc.py tool](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/TestDataDocumentationTool) is not compatible with RF 2.6 ([issue 908](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=908)). Hopefully this useful tool can be fixed already in 2.6.1.

## Many internal APIs have changed ##

There are lot of internal changes in a big release like this and some of the changes may affect libraries or tools that are dependent on the internal APIs. The most important changes are listed in [issue 907](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=907).

## Deprecated keywords and arguments were removed ##

Following earlier deprecated keywords or arguments have been removed:

  * `deprecated_absolute` argument from `List Directory` keywords ([issue 506](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=506))
  * `Create File With Encoding` keyword ([issue 507](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=507))
  * `Set Screenshot Directory` and `log_file_directory` argument from ScreenshotLibrary ([issue 733](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=733)).

## Other possible backwards incompatible changes ##

  * It is not possible to fully remove tag statistics and suite statistics tables from reports ([issue 877](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=877)).
  * `<test>` tag in XML output does not contain `critical` attribute anymore ([issue 821](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=821)).
  * If a listener method fails, it is not called anymore ([issue 832](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=832)).
  * Integer variables like `${42}` nowadays have `int` type and not `long`.
  * Some errors that used to be uncatchable are now normal errors ([issue 736](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=736)).
  * The syntax for custom regexps with embedded arguments ([issue 854](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=854)) causes problems if your embedded arguments have `:` in their name. This should not be too common.

# Deprecated features #

The only deprecated feature in RF 2.6 is that old screenshot taking keywords
have been deprecated ([issue 733](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=733)).

# Acknowledgements #

Very big thanks to the
[JSXGraph](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsxgraph)
project for creating and releasing the
[JSXCompressor](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/2009/09/29/jsxcompressor-zlib-compressed-javascript-code)
module.
One reason new logs and reports are so small is that all larger
strings are compressed using the [zlib](http://zlib.org) algorithm
and then uncompressed on-demand in the browser using this great module.

Special thanks to Alfred Wassermann for making JSXCompressor available
also under the Apache 2 license so that it was easier for us to
include it.

Big thanks also to all [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) developers for
making Javascript development a joy.

Thanks to Imran for providing a great patch to [issue 897](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=897) and for actively
testing the preview releases. Thanks also to all others who have tested
alphas, betas, and release candidates!

# Robot Framework 2.6.1 #

Robot Framework 2.6.1 is a micro release that fixes the library documentation tool which inserted too many whitespace characters in Robot Framework 2.6.0.

This doesn't affect normal Robot functionality at all. Only the packages with libdoc tool or the generated documentation are released.

Packages are available on the [download page](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/downloads/list).

| **ID** | **Type** | **Priority** | **Summary** |
|:-------|:---------|:-------------|:------------|
| [Issue 922](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=922) | Defect   | Medium       | Libdoc adds too many whitespace characters to generated docs |

Altogether 1 issues.


# Robot Framework 2.6.2 #

Robot Framework 2.6.2 is a minor release which fixes a couple of high impact bugs and adds some nice usability enhancements. It was released on Friday 30th September 2011.

It is now possible to log safely from listener methods via the logging API ([issue 548](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=548), [issue 953](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=953)) and this is documented also in the user guide.
A serious bug with using Python `logging` module from thread ([issue 950](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=950)) was fixed. We also enhanced the generated HTML files by adding sortable columns to report ([issue 969](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=969)), favicons ([issue 970](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=970)), and by ensuring that IE users are not forced to IE 7 compatibility mode ([issue 957](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/issues/detail?id=957)).
