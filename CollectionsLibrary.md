`Collections` is Robot Framework's standard library that provides a set
of keywords for handling Python lists and dictionaries. This library
has keywords, for example, for modifying and getting values from lists
and dictionaries (e.g. `Append To List`, `Get From Dictionary`) and
for verifying their contents (e.g. `Lists Should Be Equal`,
`Dictionary Should Contain Value`). [BuiltIn library](BuiltInLibrary.md)
has also some additional keywords that can be used with lists and
dictionaries.

The full library documentation by release is found below. The
documentation of the latest minor version (e.g. 2.0.4) is always
applicable with earlier minor versions.
