Most of the Robot Framework documentation is in separate version specific user guides, which contain also standard library and supporting tool documentations. If you want to get a brief introduction of Robot Framework and an overview of its most important features, you may want to look at the [Quick Start Guide](QuickStartGuide.md) instead.

Different user guide versions can be [downloaded](https://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/Downloads?tm=2) separately and they are also available online through this page:
