# Mailing List Descriptions #

All Robot Framework mailing lists are hosted on [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com).

[robotframework-users](http://groups.google.com/group/robotframework-users)
  * General discussion about all Robot Framework related issues. Questions and problems can be sent to this list. Used also for information sharing for all users.

[robotframework-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/robotframework-devel)
  * Discussion about Robot Framework development.

[robotframework-commit](http://groups.google.com/group/robotframework-commit)
  * Information about commits to the Robot Framework svn repository. Used to follow the Robot Framework development. Messages cannot be sent to this list.

[robotframework-announce](http://groups.google.com/group/robotframework-announce)
  * An announcements-only mailing list for Robot Framework related releases. All announcements are sent automatically to the [robotframework-users](http://groups.google.com/group/robotframework-users) mailing list, so there is no need to join both lists.

# Reading and Joining Mailing Lists #

All the mailing list archives can be read without joining. You can join mailing lists on the respective mailing lists' web pages. However, sending mail requires joining the list. There is a small delay in your first mail, as it is moderated to prevent spam. After the first mail, there should be no more delay.

# Mailing List Etiquette #

Please send all questions to the [robotframework-users](http://groups.google.com/group/robotframework-users) mailing list. Use common sense when sending mails to mailing lists. Good instructions can be found from the [subversion project's web pages](http://subversion.tigris.org/mailing-lists.html). Instructions on how to ask good questions can be found from [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
