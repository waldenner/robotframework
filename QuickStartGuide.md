# Quick Start Guide #

Robot Framework Quick Start Guide introduces the most important features of the framework and acts also as an executable demo. Before executing it, you need to have Robot Framework [installed](Installation.md). All the features are explained in detail in the [Robot Framework User Guide](UserGuide.md).

The guide, and everything needed to run it as a demo, is available as a [separate ZIP package](http://robotframework.googlecode.com/files/robotframework-quickstart-20090113.zip). The latest version of the guide is always available for _**[viewing online](http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/doc/quickstart/quickstart.html)**_.

To more demos using Robot Framework, take a look at  [SeleniumLibrary](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-seleniumlibrary) and
[SwingLibrary](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-swinglibrary) projects. See also this great [Robot Framework tutorial](http://www.virtuousprogrammer.com/?p=264).
