**Nokia Siemens Networks**

> Nokia Siemens Networks started developing Robot Framework 2005 in tight collaboration
> with one business line. Currently Robot Framework has over one thousand users in several
> business lines, there are tens of thousands of test cases implemented with it running
> daily, and the usage is growing rapidly. The framework is used to test various different
> technologies like Web GUIs, Swing applications and TCP/IP based proprietary protocols. It
> is used in small one team projects as well as very large multisite projects.
