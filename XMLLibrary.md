As the name implies, `XML` is a test library for verifying contents of XML files. In practice it is a pretty thin wrapper on top of Python's [ElementTree XML API](http://docs.python.org/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html).

`XML` library is available from Robot Framework 2.7.4 onwards, and it was heavily enhanced in RF 2.7.5. It works also with older 2.7 versions, but must be
[downloaded](http://robotframework.googlecode.com/hg/src/robot/libraries/XML.py) separately.

The full library documentation by release is found below. The
documentation of the latest minor version (e.g. 2.7.5) is always
applicable with earlier minor versions.
