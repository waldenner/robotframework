`Screenshot` is Robot Framework's standard library that provides
keywords to capture and store screenshots of the whole desktop. This library was initially supported only with Jython, but version 2.5.5 and newer work work also with Python. Running on Python requires some external modules as explained in the documentation linked below.

In addition, all the old keywords were obsoleted in 2.5.5, so the 2.5.4 documentation should be consulted for earlier 2.5.x releases.

The full library documentation by release is found below. The
documentation of the latest minor version (e.g. 2.0.4) is always
applicable with earlier minor versions.
