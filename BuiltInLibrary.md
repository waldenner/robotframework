`BuiltIn` is Robot Framework's standard library that provides a set of
generic keywords needed often. It is imported automatically and thus
always available. The provided keywords can be used, for example, for
verifications (e.g. `Should Be Equal`, `Should Contain`), conversions
(e.g. `Convert To Integer`) and for various other purposes
(e.g. `Log`, `Sleep`, `Run Keyword If`, `Set Global Variable`).

The full library documentation by release is found below. The
documentation of the latest minor version (e.g. 2.0.4) is always
applicable with earlier minor versions.
