`OperatingSystem` is Robot Framework's standard library that enables
various operating system related tasks to be performed in the system
where Robot Framework is running. It can, among other things, execute
commands (e.g. `Run`), create and remove files and directories
(e.g. `Create File`, `Remove Directory`), check whether files or
directories exists or contain something (e.g. `File Should Exist`,
`Directory Should Be Empty`) and manipulate environment variables
(e.g. `Set Environment Variable`).

The full library documentation by release is found below. The
documentation of the latest minor version (e.g. 2.0.4) is always
applicable with earlier minor versions.
