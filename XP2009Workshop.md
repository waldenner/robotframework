## Abstract ##

Executable requirements neatly combine two important
[Extreme Programming (XP)](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/)
practices: _user stories_ and _acceptance testing_. They enhance communication,
ease following the number of _running tested features_ during an
iteration, and work as regression tests in future iterations. This workshop
does not only give an introduction to this important process, but also
shows how it is used in developing a real system in front of the audience.
Some of the participants can even join the fun and get real hands-on
experience.

# Example project #

The system under test and development in the session is [RFDoc](http://code.google.com/p/rfdoc/), web based system for storing and searching Robot Framework test library and resource file documentations. It is available as a separate open source project and naturally developed using the _acceptance test driven development (ATDD)_ approach.


# Registration to the workshop #
