`Dialogs` is Robot Framework's standard library that provides means
for pausing the test execution and getting input from users. The
dialogs are slightly different depending on are tests run on Python or
Jython but they provide the same functionality.

`Dialogs` library is available from Robot Framework 2.1 onwards. It works also with older versions but must be
[downloaded](http://robotframework.googlecode.com/svn/tags/robotframework-2.1.2/src/robot/libraries/Dialogs.py)
separately.

The full library documentation by release is found below. The
documentation of the latest minor version (e.g. 2.1.3) is always
applicable with earlier minor versions.
